In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **10-Structured-Streaming** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **3.Streaming-With-Event-Hubs-Demo** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Connect to Event Hubs and write a stream to your event hub
- Read a stream from your event hub
- Define a schema for the JSON payload and parse the data do display it within a table

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
