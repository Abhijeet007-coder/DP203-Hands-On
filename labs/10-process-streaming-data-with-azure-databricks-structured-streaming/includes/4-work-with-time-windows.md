In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **10-Structured-Streaming** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **2.Time-Windows** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Use sliding windows to aggregate over chunks of data rather than all data
- Apply watermarking to throw away stale old data that you do not have space to keep
- Plot live graphs using `display`

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
