In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **04-Working-With-Dataframes** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **2.Use-common-dataframe-methods** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Develop familiarity with the `DataFrame` APIs
- Use common DataFrame methods for performance
- Explore the Spark API documentation

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
