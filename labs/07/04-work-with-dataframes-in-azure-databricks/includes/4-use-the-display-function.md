In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **04-Working-With-Dataframes** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **3.Display-function** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

Within the notebook, you will:

- Learn the transformations...
  - `limit(..)`
  - `select(..)`
  - `drop(..)`
  - `distinct()`
  - `dropDuplicates(..)`
- Learn the actions...
  - `show(..)`
  - `display(..)`

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
