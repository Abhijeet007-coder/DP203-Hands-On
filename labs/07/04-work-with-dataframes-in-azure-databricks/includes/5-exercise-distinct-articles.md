In your Azure Databricks workspace, open the **04-Working-With-Dataframes** folder that you imported within your user folder.

Open the **4.Exercise: Distinct Articles** notebook. Make sure you attach your cluster to the notebook before following the instructions and running the cells within.

In this exercise, you read Parquet files, apply necessary transformations, perform a total count of records, then verify that all the data was correctly loaded. As a bonus, try defining a schema that matches the data and update the read operation to use the schema.

> Note: You will find a corresponding notebook within the `Solutions` subfolder. This contains completed cells for the exercise. Refer to the notebook if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.

After you've completed the notebook, return to this screen, and continue to the next step.
