        - content: createTempView()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This method name is incorrect.
        - content: createTempViewDF()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This method name is incorrect.
        - content: createOrReplaceTempView()
          explanation: Correct. You use this method to create temporary views in DataFrames.
          isCorrect: true
    - content: "How do you create a DataFrame object?"
      choices:
        - content: Introduce a variable name and equate it to something like myDataFrameDF =.
          explanation: Correct. This approach is the correct way to create DataFrame objects.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Use the createDataFrame() function.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: There's no such method for creating a DataFrame.
        - content: Use the DF.create() syntax.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This syntax is incorrect, and this approach isn't the right way to create DataFrame objects.
    - content: "How do you cache data into the memory of the local executor for instant access?"
      choices:
        - content: .save().inMemory()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This syntax is incorrect.
        - content: .inMemory().save()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This syntax is incorrect.
        - content: .cache()
          explanation: Correct. The cache() method is an alias for persist(). Calling this moves data into the memory of the local executor.

    - content: "What is the Python syntax for defining a DataFrame in Spark from an existing Parquet file in DBFS?"
      choices:

          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This syntax is incorrect.
        - content: IPGeocodeDF = spark.read.parquet("dbfs:/mnt/training/ip-geocode.parquet")
          explanation: This syntax is correct.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: IPGeocodeDF = spark.parquet.read("dbfs:/mnt/training/ip-geocode.parquet")
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This syntax is incorrect.
