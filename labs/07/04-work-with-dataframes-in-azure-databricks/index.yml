  - Cache a DataFrame for quicker operations if the data is needed a second time
  - Use the limit function to display a small set of rows from a larger DataFrame
  - Use select() to select a subset of columns from a DataFrame
  - Use distinct() and dropDuplicates to remove duplicate data
  - Use drop() to remove columns from a DataFrame
